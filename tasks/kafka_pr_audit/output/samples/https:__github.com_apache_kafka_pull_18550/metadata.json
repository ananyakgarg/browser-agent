    "merged_despite_failed_checks": "Yes. The PR was merged by chia7712 on Jan 15, 2025 despite the CI workflow failing due to 'build / JUnit tests Java 17' check failing with exit code 1. The failure appears to be a test failure in JUnit tests on Java 17, which the maintainer likely determined was unrelated to the PR changes (a common flaky test scenario in the Kafka project).",
