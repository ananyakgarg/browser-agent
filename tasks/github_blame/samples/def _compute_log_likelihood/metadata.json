This changed the computational logic of functions like _estimate_log_gaussian_prob, _compute_precision_cholesky, _compute_log_det_cholesky, and related log-probability computation functions throughout the file.",

The file contains related log-likelihood functions: _estimate_log_gaussian_prob (line 490), _estimate_log_prob (line 903), and _compute_lower_bound (line 912). All were materially modified by the array API support commit within the past year."
