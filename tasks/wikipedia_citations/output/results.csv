https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III,The Basel III requirements were published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010,https://www.bis.org/press/p100912.pdf,2010,active,accurate,"The source is a press release dated September 12, 2010, from the Bank for International Settlements titled 'Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision announces higher global minimum capital standards.' The press release confirms that on September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced a substantial strengthening of existing capital requirements and fully endorsed Basel III reforms. The document details the specific Basel III capital requirements including: raising minimum common equity from 2% to 4.5%, introducing a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, and implementing countercyclical buffers. The source directly supports the Wikipedia claim that Basel III requirements were published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010. Both the PDF and HTML (.htm) versions of the source are accessible and functional."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank,"In 1895, Edmund Landau suggested using it for determining the winner of a chess tournament.",No URL provided - bibliographic reference only,1895,No online source available,unsupported,"The oldest citation on the PageRank Wikipedia page is reference [12] from 1895 by Edmund Landau titled 'Zur relativen Wertbemessung der Turnierresultate' (On the relative valuation of tournament results) published in a German mathematical journal. The citation supports the claim that Landau suggested using the eigenvalue problem for determining chess tournament winners in 1895. However, no URL link is provided in the Wikipedia citation - it is only a bibliographic reference to a 129-year-old German academic paper. Without access to the actual source document, the claim cannot be verified. The citation appears to be a proper academic reference format but the actual source content is not accessible online to confirm whether it accurately represents what Landau wrote about chess tournaments and eigenvalue problems."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem),"The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055638,1976,accessible via Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20191122225638/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055638); original IEEE link blocked but archived version available,accurate,"The citation supports the claim that Diffie and Hellman published the concept of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem in 1976. The paper 'New directions in cryptography' was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Volume 22, Issue 6, November 1976, pages 644-654. The abstract confirms the paper discusses 'new types of cryptographic systems, which minimize the need for secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature,' which aligns with the concept of public-key cryptography. While the direct IEEE link is blocked, the Wayback Machine archive from November 22, 2019 provides access to the full bibliographic details and abstract. The claim accurately represents what the source says - Diffie and Hellman did introduce and publish the concept of asymmetric (public-private key) cryptography in 1976."
