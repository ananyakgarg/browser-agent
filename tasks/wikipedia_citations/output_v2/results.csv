https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III,Basel II Comprehensive version part 2: The First Pillar – Minimum Capital Requirements,Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,November 2005,https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs128b.pdf,live,N/A,"Advocates a change in the accounting standards towards an expected loss (EL) approach (usually, EL amount := LGD*PD*EAD).[38]","partially accurate — The referenced Basel II document (p. 86) defines the expected loss formula EL = LGD×PD×EAD, which supports the mathematical notation in the claim. However, the source is a Basel II document being cited in the context of Basel III's advocacy for an EL-based accounting approach, making it a supporting definitional reference rather than a direct Basel III source."

Historical consensus confirms that: (1) it was indeed the earliest such publication, predating Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion; (2) it had little impact for decades until rediscovered by Paul Samuelson in the late 1950s; and (3) it included limitations (e.g., allowed negative asset prices) that restrict its direct applicability to modern markets. The reference directly and accurately supports all aspects of the claim."

This initial work used synthetic RNA antisense oligonucleotides complementary to a pre-mature stop codon mutation in a dystrophin sequence to activate A-to-I editing of the stop codon to a read through codon in a model xenopus cell system.,accurate
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method,Note on census-taking in Monte Carlo calculations,"Fermi, Enrique; Richtmyer, Robert D.",1948,http://scienze-como.uninsubria.it/bressanini/montecarlo-history/fermi-1948.pdf,live,N/A,The origins of Quantum Monte Carlo methods are often attributed to Enrico Fermi and Robert Richtmyer who developed in 1948 a mean-field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions.[37],"accurate — The reference is Fermi and Richtmyer's 1948 Los Alamos report on Monte Carlo calculations (census-taking methods for neutron-chain reactions), which directly supports the article's claim that they developed a mean-field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions in 1948."

In 1895, Edmund Landau suggested using it for determining the winner of a chess tournament.","accurate — The reference is an 1895 paper by Edmund Landau in Deutsches Wochenschach proposing the use of eigenvalue-based ranking for chess tournament results, which directly and correctly supports the article's claim that Landau applied this concept to determining chess tournament winners in 1895."

However, given the relatively expensive computers needed to implement it at the time, it was considered to be mostly a curiosity and, as far as is publicly known, was never deployed. His ideas and concepts were not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.",accurate

The article reproduces the legal text of the law verbatim, and the reference correctly points to that authoritative source."

The reference correctly supports the claim about the historical origin of the 'dynamic links' concept used in the fast weight controller architecture."
