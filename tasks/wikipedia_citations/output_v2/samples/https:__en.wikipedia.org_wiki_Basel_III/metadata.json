    "citation_accuracy_assessment": "partially accurate \u2014 The referenced Basel II document (p. 86) defines the expected loss formula EL = LGD\u00d7PD\u00d7EAD, which supports the mathematical notation in the claim. However, the source is a Basel II document being cited in the context of Basel III's advocacy for an EL-based accounting approach, making it a supporting definitional reference rather than a direct Basel III source."
